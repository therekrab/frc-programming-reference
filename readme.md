# Programming Reference Book

This book is intended to be a living document; that is, edits to this book are
not only encouraged, but also necessary to keep this a usable tool in
introducing students to FRC.

## Why not WPILib docs?

The WPILib documentation is probably the single best resource for programming
in FRC. However, there are a few reasons this document is different and used:

1. This is more of a full-project guide. It isn't intended to completely
   replace the docs - only supplement them. Although this does mean there will
   be some crossover between the WPILib docs and this book, this book offers a
   different perspective, with more complex, big-project, examples rather than
   just reference code.

2. This book offers advice (i.e. opinions) as to how to structure robot code
   that slightly differs from the recommendations put in place by WPILib.
   Rather than fight them, this book instead offers a different perspective and
   highlights how multiple different structures can solve the same problem in
   different ways - and touches on the differences between them.

3. This is more malleable and flexible to our team; that is, we can put basic
   tips for our workflow (CTRE, PhotonVision, etc.) to make it easier to use.
