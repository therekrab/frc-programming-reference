Debugging
=========

Sometimes code doesn't run the way it should. Sometimes hardware behaves
unexpectedly. These are facts of life for programming students. It's important
to know how to handle these sorts of scenarios.

Although it's impossible to predict anything going wrong, it's helpful to have
a "guide" to follow when trying to determine the root cause of an error.

This section guides the reader through "best practices" in debugging, starting
from identifying the problem, and ending with ensuring that solutions work as
planned.
