3.5.3 - Find and Correct
========================

Once we've got a very clear idea of what we're looking for, we can start to
look through our source code. We shouldn't have to look in many places; we've
reduced the scope of where the problem *could be* to a single part of our robot
code (see :doc:`3_5_2_identify`).

This step is best done with multiple people, following the "rubber duck
debugging" principle, which suggests that talking out loud and explaining what
the code does is a successful tactic to spot flaws in its execution. Talking
through the logic with somebody else does a few things:

1. If they're not already familiar with the project (or this part of it), they
   become more knowledgeable about how the robot program works.

2. As you explain the code line-by-line, it becomes clear what the problem is
   right away. Hearing things aloud is one of the easiest ways to realize what
   was messed up. Plus, forcing yourself to explain your decision apparently
   leads to you saying something that you catch is incorrect.

3. The other person may see something you missed yourself, which helps solve
   the problem.
