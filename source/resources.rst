Additional Resources
====================

There are a variety of supplemental resources that I've found helpful when
writing code for FRC.

Learning to code
----------------

If you're not sure where to begin learing how to code, I'd highly recommend
giving `Codecademy <https://www.codecademy.com/>`_ a try. I've used it to learn
several programming languages, and it hasn't let me down. Although some courses
are paid, I've found that you can learn pretty much everything that you need to
from the free courses.

A good coding reference is also `W3 Schools <https://www.w3schools.com/>`_.

.. warning:: In case it wasn't clear, *the above resources will not teach you
   anything about FRC coding, or WPILib*. However, it's still crucial to
   understand how to convey your ideas into code, regardless of what you're
   trying to write. An understanding of a language is irreplaceable in any form
   of coding.

WPILib Documentation
--------------------

WPILib is a massive library of prewritten code that helps tremendously when
dealing with robots in FRC. It is essential to have a good grasp on what the
library can do.

`This <docs.wpilib.org>`_ is a link to their documentation, and the `Java API
<https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html>`_, `Python
API <https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/projects/robotpy/en/stable/>`_, and `C++
API <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html>`_ can be
found here as well.

CTRE Documentation
------------------

Although this book doesn't cover anything vendor-specific, familiarity with
CTRE's library is essential for interacting with their products.

You can find their documentation `here
<https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/>`_ as well as the `Java
<https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/java/>`_, `C++
<https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/cpp/>`_, and `Python
<https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/python/>`_ APIs with their
respective links.
