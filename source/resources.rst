Additional Resources
====================

There are a variety of supplemental resources that I've found helpful when
writing code for FRC.

Learning to code (non-FRC)
--------------------------

If you're not sure where to begin learing how to code, I'd highly recommend
giving `Codecademy <https://www.codecademy.com/>`_ a try. I've used it to learn
several programming languages, and it hasn't let me down. Although some courses
are paid, I've found that you can learn pretty much everything that you need to
from the free courses.

A good coding reference is also `W3 Schools <https://www.w3schools.com/>`_.

Use these resources to familiarize yourself with the language you'll be writing
code in. You'll develop a better understanding of the language's syntax and its
quirks. Such understanding is fundamental to comprehending this book as well.

WPILib Documentation
--------------------

.. tip:: You should read through the WPILib documentation before beginning this
   book. I reintroduce some of the same concepts, but the docs (and the APIs)
   are actually what teach you what you can do with the code.

WPILib is a massive library of prewritten code that helps tremendously when
dealing with robots in FRC. It is essential to have a good grasp on what the
library can do.

`This <docs.wpilib.org>`_ is a link to their documentation, and the `Java API
<https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html>`_, `Python
API <https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/projects/robotpy/en/stable/>`_, and `C++
API <https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html>`_ can be
found here as well.

CTRE Documentation
------------------

Although this book doesn't cover anything vendor-specific, familiarity with
CTRE's library is essential for interacting with their products.

You can find their documentation `here
<https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/>`_ as well as the `Java
<https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/java/>`_, `C++
<https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/cpp/>`_, and `Python
<https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/python/>`_ APIs with their
respective links.
