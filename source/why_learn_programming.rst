Why Learn Programming?
======================

Besides its applicability in FRC, programming is an essential skill in the
modern world. Whether it's hacking together a simple solution to automate
tasks, or building complex software to analyze and report trends in data,
computers can make our lives so much easier.

Programming also builds problem-solving skills and trains our minds to think
like engineers. We have to make design decisions, and those affect our success
later. This teaches us how best to learn how to approach a problem, and it sets
us up for success all throughout life.

Programming is also a very creative exercise. It's important to know how to
come up with innovative solutions to problems, and nothing else does this
better than solving problems yourself.

Considering the rise in computing power in smaller and cheaper devices, the
tools to learn how to program are becoming more and more available to the
world's population, and now is a great time to start the journey.
