2.1 - WPILib
============

WPILib is a library that supplies a *lot* of robot-focused features. It is
organized in such a way that its users have to learn a new style of programming
\- that is, programmers will have to structure their code differently than they
may be used to.

In this section, we're going to learn about a common paradigms that have
emerged in FRC: **Command-based** programming. There are alternatives to
command-based programming in FRC, however they are not what team 3414
encourages (as of right now) and therefore will not be covered.

.. admonition:: Exception

   There *are* cases in this book where other architectural styles in FRC will
   be discussed, but simply because the best solutions often involve a blend of
   paradigms. Those will not be in this section, and instead will be in the
   section for advanced FRC programming.
