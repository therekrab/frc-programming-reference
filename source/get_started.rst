Getting Started
===============

There are a couple of things that we need to do before we can begin going through this book.

Learning to code
----------------

There are already too many resources to learn how to code on the internet
today; therefore, such content will not be taught directly in this book.
Instead, it's recommended to use `Codecademy <https://codecademy.com>`_ to
learn Java.

Codecademy is a *great* place to learn how to write Java code. To simplify
things further, we can use our GitHub account to sign in to Codecademy as well.

Here's the steps to get started:

1. Navigate to `Codecademy's sign up page
   <https://www.codecademy.com/register>`_.

2. Sign in through GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account, then read the
   section on GitHub later in this page.

3. Go to `this page <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java>`_. This is
   the course that teaches enough Java to get started.

4. Start learning!

Required Software
-----------------

To continue with this book, there's some important software that we must
install. This section provides links to each resource, but any troubleshooting
is left to the reader. If there are multiple options on a screen, the most
likely solution to know which to select is simplhy *read the page*. It's
shocking how many mistakes happen because somebody just didn't read the
description. Take your time, and *read*.

.. note:: This is *not* all of the software that will be necessary
   throughout the season. This is only an installation of what is necessary to
   continue with this book.

Git
~~~

Git is a version control system (covered in :doc:`git/1_2_what_is_git`) that we
use to manage the growing structure and history of our project.

Navigate to the `Git installation page <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.
Select your OS, and continue to the OS-specific download steps.

WPILib + VS Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: If you have a pre-existing version of VS Code installed, *you
   still need to do this step*.

VS Code is software that is meant to help write code. Think of it like a
Microsoft Word app, but for code. It offers advanced features like code
autocompletion, and is what we need to be able to build code and deploy (send)
it to the robot.

You can find the latest releases `here
<https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/latest>`_. Scroll down to
the **Downloads** section, and select your operating system. Read `this part of
the docs
<https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html>`_
of the WPILib docs to guide you through what to select if you're unsure. This
page tells you what buttons to press for each step along the way.

.. tip:: It doesn't matter if you select "Install for this user" and "Install
   for all users", so that's up to you.
   Mer

GitHub
------

Team 3414 uses GitHub to remotely store and share our project's code. We'll
talk about GitHub in much more detail in :doc:`git/1_3_github`.

Creating a new account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: If you've already got a GitHub account, you can skip this step.

To create a new account, go to the `GitHub signup page <https://github.com/signup>`_. Enter your
information and follow the steps to configure your account.

.. admonition:: Which email to use?

   For GitHub, you should *avoid* using school-provided emails. This is because
   GitHub is a great start to develop your portfolio, but if your email gets
   deleted, you'll lose access to your account upon graduation. Use a personal
   email to make sure that you have access to your account.

Join teams' Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to talk to a programming mentor on the team to make sure that
you're part of the correct organization. Only students who are part of the
organization for the team are allowed to make contributions to the codebase, as
per our security configuration.
