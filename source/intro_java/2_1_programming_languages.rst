2.1 - Programming Languages
===========================

Let's talk quickly about what the word "programming language" even means before
we start to learn how to work with them.

First and foremost, the second word in the name is the most important idea
here: "language". Language is a standard of communication. It conveys ideas
into a suitable format for others, who also know the rules of our language, to
understand.

Languages are powerful things, because they allow us to convey ideas to other
people. However, programming languages are meant to convey ideas to a computer.

Langauges are guided by a certain set of rules. I can say "I ate a fine
breakfast this great morning", but it's nonsensical if I say "fine a morning
great ate this breakfast I". Each of these words is *technically* correct, but
when put together, they make no sense at all.

We could argue that another person knowledgeable of the language we speak could
piece together what this means, but this requires the other person to make
assumptions about what we mean. Did I mean to say "I ate a great breakfast this
fine morning", or "I ate a fine breakfast this great morning"? This is called
*ambiguity*. Although people can make assumptions about what you mean,
computers don't do that. They will only do exactly what you tell them, so they
aren't allowed to every assume what your intent is.

The main idea is that programming languages are just another form of languages,
except without ambiguity. They are readable by the computer, yes, but that's
because of the lack of ambiguity. Provided that what you say is linguistically
valid, the computer will follow the same instructions every time - and won't
change its fundamental behavior unless you tell it to.

Learning a programming language is a great thing, becuase it helps develop your
mind to think algorithmically, a great skill to have.

Just remember the main idea: programming languages are just languages, forms of
communication between yourself and the computer.
