4 - Writeups
============

.. note:: This is currently a WIP and is empty as of right now. Expect more in
   the future.

This section is different from the other sections in this book; instead of
teaching general programming knowledge, this section contains writeups for many
different subprojects used for a real robot.

This section acts as a development log that records my intent and process when
writing code for a real robot. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical
understanding and real programming through examples.

Unlike the other sections of this book, the order of these sections is
completely irrelevant and does not matter. As such, these sections will not be
numbered with 3.4.X and instead will just be a name.
