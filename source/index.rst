The Programming Reference Book
==============================

Welcome to the Programming Reference Book, written by team 3414's software
team.

This book is intended to be a supplementary tool to be used in the preseason to
train new members for software and (in the advanced section) establish a
baseline structure for a robot project that works well during the build season.

Covering topics from introductory Git to advanced architecture patterns in FRC
code, this book will be long and full of information. For that reason, this
book is divided into several sections, which can be found in the contents bar.

Each section is focused on a different topic (e.g. Git, WPILib Basics, etc.)
and contains many pages with more specific content.
