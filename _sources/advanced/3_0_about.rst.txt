3.0 - Guide to the Advanced Section
===================================

After learning the most basic aspects of robot programming, it's time to move
into the next section of programming. Advanced style, architectures, and "best
practices" that are beyond the scope of the introductory section are listed
here.

Oftentimes, this section will have code that goes *beyond* the documentation
provided by WPILib and is much less objective - however, it offers a more
complete solution to writing robot code. In theory, this section should contain
all of the knowledge needed to fully program a robot.

Each of these sections focuses on a different part of writing robot code, and
is developed through practice and real use. Some of these sections are
recommendations purely about code structure, others deal with real solutions to
problems and advice for features.

.. important:: Because of the nature of this section, this is *not* an absolute
   set of instructions for programming. It's better to write code that works
   well for your situation than force a different architecture.
